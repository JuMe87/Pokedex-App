This app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. An external API is used to fetch specific data. Since this is a Pokédex app, a list of Pokémons is being displayed. When the user clicks on the name of a pokemon, a modal appears displaying further details on the pokemon (image, height, weight, and types) fetched from an external API.

This is my first project and is part of Career Foundry's Full Stack Web Development course. 

The app uses the following API to load information on pokemon: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150
